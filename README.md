# Enlightenment

Arduino Project - [Link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9jZ-16L-fY)

I have used two mediums in the artwork that is Processing and Arduino. I used processing to extract the data from the excel file ‘Lotus Genome Sequence’ and connect it with Arduino to process data. This gave me accurate information if it established a connection
with Arduino or not. I then used the mousePressed function which enables me to run through all the different 4 letters inside. Arduino on the other hand inputs the data from the LED pin and
the data that comes from the serial port of processing. Colors were then assigned to different letters. A is red, C is green, T is blue and G is purple.

The whole idea behind this project is to extract the DNA or the Lotus Genome sequence and present that in my own way. Upon research, I found that it is scientifically
called as Lotus japonicus which is the ideal plant for genome studies and known as ‘sacred lotus.’ According to scientists, it is a powerful way of enlightenment. Using this information I have used LED that will be my source of enlightenment and will associate that to each
letter that represents the genome sequence. This way I can make it visually appealing while depicting the sequence and pattern of letters. 

“Enlightenment” is taken both literally and figuratively in this case; there’s literal use of lights, as well as alluding to the feeling of enlightenment upon discovering the answer to
something, in this case, the morse code light patterns.
